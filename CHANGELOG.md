## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-26

Major release. v2.0 introduces three desktop-first surfaces — a native macOS menu bar, in-app Clone & Fork, and an opt-in beta update channel — plus an OpenAI Codex CLI provider, a shortlog-driven Contributors widget, and a tightened follow-up pass on the menu bar that lights up Find in Log, Merge…, Open in Terminal, Toggle Sidebar, and Undo Last Operation.

### Added — v2.0 surfaces

- **Native macOS menu bar** — full File / Edit / Repository / View / Window / Help via `@tauri-apps/api/menu`. Built entirely from the frontend so labels come from `useI18n()` and rebuild on locale + repo open/close. Predefined OS items (Cut/Copy/Paste/Hide/Quit/Minimize/Fullscreen) keep first-responder routing intact — Cmd+Z stays webview-default for text undo. macOS-only via `navigator.platform` gate.
- **Clone & Fork from the UI** — three entry points for `git clone <url> <dest>` and `gh repo fork <url> --clone --remote-name=upstream`: secondary buttons under the empty state, a `+` dropdown on the tab strip (teleported to body to escape the strip's overflow clip), and File menu items. Backends are 3-layer (Rust + dev-server + TS wrapper) per the project convention; modals are `BaseModal`-based with auto-derived destination paths.
- **Auto-update channels (stable / beta)** — `Settings.updateChannel` ref and a new `fetchBetaUpdate(currentVersion)` that compares semver locally against `latest-beta.json`. Stable keeps the Tauri plugin's auto-install path; beta switches to a manual flow (open the GitHub release page) because `tauri-plugin-updater` doesn't support runtime endpoint override. CHANGELOG note: the GitHub Actions workflow still needs to publish `latest-beta.json` on `v*-beta.*` tags — tracked as a follow-up.
- **OpenAI Codex CLI provider** — `codex-cli` added to `useAIProvider` mirroring the Claude Code CLI flow. Backend has `resolve_codex_binary` + `detect_codex_cli` + `codex_cli_prompt` (uses `codex exec "<prompt>"` — no `--quiet`, that flag doesn't exist on `exec`). Settings UI matches the Claude block: detect on mount, status states (not_found / not_logged_in / connected) with install hint.
- **5 deferred menu items, now wired** — `Find in Log` (Cmd+F focuses the existing `CommitLog.searchQuery` input via a `LOG_FOCUS_SEARCH_KEY` provide/inject bridge after switching `viewMode` to "history"), `Merge…` (opens `AppHeader.openMergePopover()` via `MERGE_POPOVER_REQUEST_KEY`), `Open in Terminal` (Cmd+Shift+T mounts `GitTerminal` in a stash-overlay shell), `Toggle Sidebar` (Cmd+Shift+S, new `showSidebar` ref defaulted true), `Undo Last Operation` (Cmd+Shift+U opens the existing rewind popover via `UNDO_POPOVER_REQUEST_KEY`). Toggle Light/Dark Mode loses Cmd+Shift+T (now claimed by Open in Terminal per spec) — stays in the menu without an accelerator; the header chip remains the primary entry.

### Changed — v2.0 surfaces

- **Dashboard contributors** — backend `git_shortlog` (3 layers) replaces the windowed-log aggregation. `contributorCount` becomes a computed derived from `allContributors.length`, `topContributors` no longer slices to 4. Layout converts to a horizontal scroll rail: cards take `(100% - 2×gap)/3` with `min-width: 180px` and `scroll-snap-align: start`, so a fourth contributor peeks in to cue the scroll.
- **`AIProvider` type unified** — `SettingsPanel.vue` redeclared the union inline and silently drifted from `useAIProvider.ts`. Replaced with a re-export so the canonical declaration has a single home.
- **`@gitwand/core`, `@gitwand/cli`, `@gitwand/mcp`, `@gitwand/desktop`, `gitwand-website`** all bumped to `2.0.0` via `scripts/bump-version.sh`. `@gitwand/mcp/server.json` (root + packages[0] version) and `packages/mcp/src/server.ts` aligned.

### Added

- **Commit context menu** — right-click any commit in the Log to get a full action menu. Twelve entries in four groups:
  - *Navigation* — **Checkout commit** (modal with detached-HEAD warning); **Reset to commit** (soft / mixed / hard selector, danger styling and explicit warning on `--hard`, `repoRefresh()` called after to keep the staged/unstaged panel in sync).
  - *Branching* — **Create branch here** (`git checkout -b <name> <sha>`); **Tag this commit** (lightweight or annotated depending on whether a message is supplied); **Cherry-pick onto current branch**.
  - *History* — **Revert commit** (non-destructive, merge commits handled via `-m 1`); **Amend** (HEAD only); **Split** (HEAD only, no merge commits — routes to the existing split-commit modal).
  - *Clipboard & forge* — **Copy short SHA**, **Copy full SHA**, **Copy commit message** (summary + body); **View on GitHub / GitLab / Bitbucket** (URL derived from `gitRemoteInfo`).
- **Four new backend primitives** (Rust + Node dev-server + TypeScript wrapper, three layers each): `git_checkout_commit`, `git_reset_to_commit`, `git_revert_commit`, `git_create_tag`. `git_create_branch` extended with an optional `start_point` parameter (backward-compatible).
- **`useCommitActions` composable** (`composables/useCommitActions.ts`, 244 lines) — encapsulates modal state, all handlers, and confirm callbacks extracted from `App.vue`. App.vue shrinks by 172 lines.
- **37 i18n keys** for the commit context menu translated across all 5 locales (`en`, `fr`, `es`, `pt-BR`, `zh-CN`), zero TypeScript errors.

### Changed

- Commit context-menu modals use `BaseModal` (consistent background, border-radius, slide-in animation, close button, footer layout) instead of hand-rolled overlays.
- `RepoSidebar` now forwards the 7 new commit context-menu events (`checkoutCommit`, `resetToCommit`, `revertCommit`, `createBranchFromCommit`, `tagCommit`, `cherryPickCommit`, `viewOnForge`) from its internal `CommitLog` up to `App.vue`.

- **Tags panel** — the ◇ button in the sidebar tab strip opens a `BaseModal`-based panel listing all local tags sorted by semver/date. Per-tag actions appear on hover: push to remote (single tag) and delete local (with optional remote deletion, confirmed via a sub-modal). A "Push all tags" button at the top sends `--tags` to the configured remote. Four new backend primitives (Rust + Node dev-server + TypeScript wrapper): `git_list_tags`, `git_delete_tag`, `git_push_tags`, `git_delete_remote_tag`.
- **Ref badges in CommitLog list view** — branch, tag, and remote ref badges now appear below the commit meta line in the Log sidebar list (not just in the DAG graph). Branch/HEAD badges are accent-purple; tag badges are amber; remote refs are muted grey.
- **AI tag suggestion** (`useTagSuggestion.ts`) — a ✦ Suggest button appears in the "Tag this commit" modal when an AI provider is configured. One click fetches the latest tag, collects commits since it via `git log <lastTag>..HEAD --oneline`, and asks the model to propose the next semver bump (major/minor/patch based on conventional-commit types) plus a one-line annotated tag message. Both fields are filled simultaneously.
- **Commit trailers** — the commit panel in the sidebar now shows two checkboxes below the description: `Signed-off-by` (auto-filled from `git config user.name/email`, loaded eagerly on mount) and `Reviewed-by` (checkbox + free-text input). When checked, the trailers are appended as a conventional trailer block (`\n\n<trailers>`) to the commit message in `useGitRepo.commit()`. The AI commit-message prompts are updated to say trailers are "controlled by the user" rather than categorically banned. Three new i18n keys (`trailerSobTooltip`, `trailerRbTooltip`, `trailerRbPlaceholder`) across all 5 locales.
- **Conventional Commits type picker** — a row of monospace chips (`feat` · `fix` · `docs` · `chore` · `refactor` · `test` · `style` · `perf` · `ci`) appears above the summary input in the commit panel. Clicking a chip injects the prefix (`feat: `, `fix: `, …) at the start of the summary, replacing any existing type prefix. Clicking the active chip again removes it. The `activePrefix` computed detects the prefix in real time so the correct chip is always highlighted, including when the AI generates a conventional commit message.
- **Post-merge branch cleanup** — after a successful merge, `MergeSuccessModal` shows a "Delete «branch»" button alongside the existing Push button. An optional "Also delete from remote" checkbox runs `git push <remote> --delete <branch>` after the local deletion. The merged branch name is captured when `mergeBranch()` is called and passed as a prop to the modal.
- **File history pickaxe & line-range search** — the File History Viewer (Blame / Log / Compare tabs, opened from the clock icon in the diff header) gains two new search modes in the Log tab. A **pickaxe search bar** with S/G mode toggle lets you find every commit where a specific string (literal `-S`) or regex pattern (`-G`) was added or removed in the file. A **clock button** on each blame block runs `git log -L <start>,<end>:<file>` to show only the commits that touched that contiguous group of lines — the view switches to the Log tab automatically and displays a "Lines X–Y" banner. `git_file_log`, `git_file_log_pickaxe`, and `git_file_log_range` are now proper Rust Tauri commands (previously only in the dev-server). Four new i18n keys across all 5 locales.
- **Blame diff algorithm setting** — a new "Blame diff algorithm" selector (histogram / patience / minimal / myers) in Settings → Git tab controls `git blame --diff-algorithm=<algo>`. `git_blame` is now properly implemented as a Rust Tauri command (it was only in the dev-server before). `FileHistoryViewer` reads the setting on each blame load. Default is `histogram` which gives the best blame results for most codebases. Three new i18n keys across all 5 locales.
- **Fork / triangular workflow badge** — `GitStatus` now tracks `push_remote` and `ahead_push` when `@{push}` differs from `@{upstream}`. `SyncSplitButton` shows a subtle "↑N fork" badge in the push button when in a fork setup, making it clear how many commits are ahead of the fork vs. the upstream.
- **MCP Registry CI automation** (`publish.yml`) — a new `publish-mcp-registry` job runs after `smoke-test` on every tag push. It installs `mcp-publisher` from the official pre-built binary (no Homebrew dependency), polls npm for up to 12 minutes until `@gitwand/mcp@<version>` propagates, then runs `mcp-publisher publish` from `packages/mcp/`. Authenticated via `secrets.MCP_PUBLISHER_TOKEN` (GitHub PAT, `read:user` scope). Fixes the registry being frozen at v1.6.1 since no manual publish was run after that release. `packages/mcp/PUBLISH-TO-REGISTRY.md` updated to document the automated flow and the one required secret.

### Fixed

- `isCtxEntryHead` in `CommitLog` now guards against search mode: when a search is active, `idx === 0` no longer implies HEAD, so **Amend** and **Split** are correctly disabled for non-HEAD results.
- Checkout and Reset `--hard` now call `repoRefresh()` after completion so the staged/unstaged file panel reflects the new working-tree state immediately.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-04-23

Design-system foundations — the app header and every overlay now ride on a shared chrome. A new `BaseModal` swallows the backdrop / focus-trap / Esc handling that had drifted across 10 modals, and a companion `AiSparkle` icon retires the ad-hoc SVG copies that had accumulated around AI actions. The refactor let us revisit the surfaces that carry them — PR views, merge editor, sidebar dashboard — with a consistent hand.

### Added

- **AppHeader revamp** — the 1654-line `AppHeader.vue` monolith is split into composable building blocks under `components/header/`: `SyncSplitButton` (primary sync CTA with publish/push/pull variants + split-button menu for less-common sync actions), `BranchSelector` (rich branch popover with search and quick-switch), `BranchMenu` (secondary branch actions), `SearchTrigger` + `SearchPalette` (centered search input opening a full-screen command palette), `RepoTabStrip` (replaces `RepoTabBar` with multi-tab ergonomics), `HeaderLogo`. Each is typed, i18n'd across all 5 locales, and re-wired into `App.vue`.
- **Cmd/Ctrl+K command palette** — the new `SearchPalette` is reachable from anywhere and surfaces branches, commits, and quick actions. Centered search field in the header doubles as the palette trigger.
- **Branch rename / delete modals** — `BranchRenameModal.vue` and `BranchDeleteModal.vue` replace the inline `rename()` / `confirm()` flows in `BranchMenu`. Delete modal includes a type-the-name guard for unmerged branches. Backed by a new `git_rename_branch` primitive (Rust/Tauri + Node dev-server + TypeScript wrapper), exposed via `useGitRepo.renameBranch`.
- **`useSyncAction` composable** — central state machine for publish / push / pull / fetch / mergeRemote variants, with a unit test suite covering the transitions. Consumed by `SyncSplitButton` and `App.vue`.
- **`BaseModal.vue`** — shared overlay wrapper (backdrop, focus trap, Esc-to-close, sized footers with typed primary/danger/ghost button variants, `bm-btn` class scale pinned to (0,1,0) specificity to keep modifiers composable). 367 lines of chrome reused by 10+ modals.
- **`AiSparkle.vue`** — 77-line reusable sparkle icon for AI-powered actions. Replaces the scattered inline SVGs in the PR review modal, split commit modal, and PR intelligence panel.
- **Merge editor line numbers + minimap** — per-line numbering on code and conflict panels, and a right-side canvas minimap that highlights auto-resolvable vs manual conflicts for one-click navigation across large merges.
- **PR detail markdown description switch** — the Description block in `PrDetailView` now renders full markdown (tables, code blocks, links, blockquotes, images) via the existing `renderMarkdown` composable, with a segmented pill switch ("Formatted" / "Raw") matching the Dashboard's readme widget. New i18n keys `dashboard.formatted` / `dashboard.raw` across the 5 locales.
- **PrIntelligencePanel redesign** — emoji section icons replaced with 28px accent-soft tile + inline SVG; scope grid upgraded to `.pi-stat` cards with radial hover gradient and lift; file rows / hotspot rows / AI flag rows unified with a `border-left: 3px solid` severity strip; conflict summary became a success/danger banner; "Analyser" button is now a primary CTA with play-triangle SVG and hover lift. Loading states use a 10px `.pi-dot-spinner`. `@media (prefers-reduced-motion)` disables all transforms + spin animations.
- **PR create view polish** — `PrCreateView` restyled with an icon hero, segmented template pills, accent AI button, and highlighted draft card for a consistent PR flow with `PrDetailView`.

### Changed

- **10 modals migrated to `BaseModal`** — `EditCommitOverlay`, `MergeSuccessModal`, `PrReviewModal`, `RebaseEditor`, `SettingsPanel`, `SplitCommitModal`, `StashManager`, `BranchRenameModal`, `BranchDeleteModal`, `SearchPalette`. Net impact: duplicated backdrop/focus logic removed, accessibility fixes apply everywhere at once.
- **Sidebar dashboard refresh** — `RepoSidebar.vue` gets more padding and gaps for breathing room, icon badges, and hover lifts on branch / activity / quick-action items.
- **Folder history pill chips** — `FolderPicker.vue` switches from a vertical list to wrapping pill-shaped chips, hiding the path and shrinking pin/remove controls for a denser layout.
- `@gitwand/core`, `@gitwand/cli`, `@gitwand/mcp`, `@gitwand/desktop`, and `gitwand-website` bumped to `1.8.0`. `@gitwand/mcp` server-reported handshake version and `packages/mcp/server.json` (MCP Registry manifest) aligned to `1.8.0`.

### Docs

- ROADMAP: new **Tags management** section (UI-driven tag creation, push, log badges) and **Log commit context menu** plan (checkout / reset / revert / create branch / tag / cherry-pick / amend / copy SHA / open on forge / compare with).

## [1.7.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- **Split commit by hunks** — a new "Split this commit…" entry in the commit log's context menu opens a dedicated modal that lets you break a single commit in two by picking individual lines across files. Each file shows as a collapsible summary row (chevron, short name, path, +/- stats, hunk count, selected-lines badge); click to expand the full diff and pick lines to keep in the first commit. The rest of the changes flow into the second commit automatically. Selections persist across collapse/expand. Large commits (> 3 files) get a "Expand all / Collapse all" toolbar. A new `git_split_commit` backend primitive ships in both the Rust/Tauri (`lib.rs`) and Node (`dev-server.mjs`) paths with full parity, plus a TypeScript wrapper (`gitSplitCommit`) and a `useSplitCommit` composable.
- **Split integrated into interactive rebase** — pick a commit in the rebase editor and switch its action to `split` (alongside `pick`, `edit`, `squash`, `fixup`, `drop`). The rebase halts at that commit via a synthetic `edit` step, the split modal opens with the commit preloaded, and after you confirm the split the rebase resumes. The progress banner now stays up on `edit` / synthetic-`split` halts (they exit 0 with no conflict, which used to wrongly close the editor).
- **Merge-commit guard (defense in depth)** — splitting a merge commit would silently drop the second parent and flatten history. The guard blocks the operation at every entry point: Rust backend (`git_split_commit`), Node dev-server, TypeScript composable, the `App.vue` dispatcher, and the context-menu entry in `CommitLog.vue` (disabled with tooltip). Error message translated across all 5 locales.
- **Correct patch headers for added / deleted / renamed files** — `GitDiff` now carries `status` (`added | modified | deleted | renamed`) and `oldPath` from `git_show`. `patchBuilder` emits the matching extended header (`new file mode` + `--- /dev/null`, `deleted file mode` + `+++ /dev/null`, or `rename from/to`) so `git apply --cached` stops failing with "does not exist in index" when the split touches a file creation or deletion.
- **i18n** — 6 new strings for the split flow (`errorMergeCommit`, `filesCount`, `expandAll`, `collapseAll`, `hunksCount`, `linesSelectedSuffix`) translated across all 5 locales: `en`, `fr`, `es`, `pt-BR`, `zh-CN`.

### Changed

- Rebase-result types (`startRebase`, `rebaseContinue`, `rebaseSkip`) now carry an explicit `inProgress` flag. `conflict` is reserved for merge conflicts; `inProgress` is the authoritative "rebase still running" signal so UI callers stop conflating the two.
- `@gitwand/core`, `@gitwand/cli`, `@gitwand/mcp`, `@gitwand/desktop`, and `gitwand-website` bumped to `1.7.0`. `@gitwand/mcp` server-reported handshake version and `packages/mcp/server.json` (MCP Registry manifest) aligned to `1.7.0`.

### Fixed

- `git_show` parser: the final context-line detection site (line 1811) still used `!starts_with('\\')` instead of `starts_with(' ')`, which misclassified empty strings as context lines. Matches the fix previously applied in the primary diff parser.

## [1.6.3] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- **Worktree manager** — create, list, and remove Git worktrees from a dedicated overlay panel (header button "Worktrees"). Each worktree shows its branch, HEAD SHA, path, and status badges (main / locked / bare). "Open in tab" opens any worktree as a first-class repo tab — enabling parallel work on two branches without stashing or switching. "Prune" cleans up stale administrative files. The "New worktree" form lets you check out an existing branch or create a new one directly at the worktree.
- **Quick worktree from branch list** — every non-current branch in the branch popover now has a worktree shortcut button (⧉ icon). Clicking it opens the worktree manager with the branch pre-selected and the creation form pre-filled, so the "open this branch in a new tab without touching my working tree" flow is two clicks total.
- **Submodule panel** — new "Submodules" header button opens an overlay listing all submodules declared in `.gitmodules`, with live status badges (clean / modified / not initialized). "Init & Update all" runs `git submodule update --init --recursive`. "Open in tab" opens any initialized submodule as a standalone repo tab. "Add submodule" form (URL + local path). An inline warning banner counts uninitialized submodules and doubles as a one-click init trigger.
- **Auto-update infrastructure fixes** — `createUpdaterArtifacts: true` in `tauri.conf.json` (was missing, preventing `.sig` file generation); `updater:default`, `process:default`, `process:allow-restart` permissions added to `capabilities/default.json`; updater endpoint simplified to static `latest.json`; `release.yml` now downloads the `tauri-action`-generated manifest (with real cryptographic signatures) instead of hand-crafting one with empty signature fields.
- **i18n** — all new strings translated across all 5 locales: `en`, `fr`, `es`, `pt-BR`, `zh-CN`.

### Changed

- `tauri.conf.json` updater endpoint: `{{target}}/{{arch}}/{{current_version}}` → `latest.json` (static GitHub Pages, no dynamic server needed).

## [1.6.2] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- **Image diff viewer** — binary image files (PNG, JPG, WebP, GIF, SVG) now render in the commit diff with four comparison modes:
  - **Side-by-side** — before/after framed with dimension + size metadata
  - **Overlay** — stacked images with opacity control
  - **Blink** — alternates the two images to reveal pixel-level deltas
  - **Slider** — draggable reveal between before/after
  Includes a 20 MB per-side guardrail (oversize images are skipped with an explicit notice), safe rendering for SVG (text content, not raster), and an "animated" metadata badge for GIF. New `read_file_at_revision(path, rev)` backend command — available in both the Rust/Tauri and Node dev-server paths — fetches file bytes at any git revision so the viewer can compare `HEAD^` against `HEAD`, across branches, across stashes, etc.
- **Folder tree view in commit diff** — the file list in `CommitDiffViewer` gets a flat ↔ tree toggle. Tree mode shows an expandable folder tree with per-folder aggregates (files changed, additions, deletions) and lets you click any folder to filter the list down to its descendants — a breadcrumb + clear (×) button surfaces the active filter. The sidebar column is now **resizable by dragging its left edge**, with double-click to reset; width is clamped 180–600 px and persisted in `localStorage` (`gitwand.cdv.filelistWidth`). Full keyboard navigation (arrow keys, Enter, Esc) on the tree. New `folder_diff` backend command (3 layers: Rust/Tauri + Node/dev-server + TypeScript wrapper) builds the aggregated tree. i18n across all 5 locales (en, fr, es, pt-BR, zh-CN).

### Changed

- `@gitwand/core`, `@gitwand/cli`, `@gitwand/mcp`, `@gitwand/desktop`, and `gitwand-website` bumped to `1.6.2`. `@gitwand/mcp` server-reported protocol version and `packages/mcp/server.json` (MCP Registry manifest) aligned to `1.6.2` so registry consumers see a consistent version.

### Docs

- `packages/mcp/README.md` — document the two supported install paths for `mcp-publisher` (Homebrew and prebuilt binary) so new contributors aren't blocked on the registry-publish step.

### Internals

- `.gitignore` ignores Vite's `*.timestamp-*.mjs` temp files and the `.release-notes-*.md` scratch notes so they stop surfacing in `git status`.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed

- **`@gitwand/mcp` missing `mcpName` field** — the MCP Registry rejects submissions whose referenced npm package lacks the `mcpName` field (ownership-verification mechanism preventing squatting). `@gitwand/mcp@1.6.0` was published without it, so the initial registry submission failed with HTTP 400. Fix: add `"mcpName": "io.github.devlint/gitwand"` to `packages/mcp/package.json` and re-publish as `1.6.1`.
- **`@gitwand/mcp` server-reported version** — `src/server.ts` hardcoded the protocol handshake version to `1.6.0`, now bumped to `1.6.1` in sync with package.json.

### Changed

- `packages/mcp/server.json` (MCP Registry manifest) bumped to `1.6.1` accordingly. `@gitwand/core` and `@gitwand/cli` remain at `1.6.0` — no code change needed there.

### Docs

- Root README and `packages/mcp/README.md` show an **MCP Registry** badge pointing to `registry.modelcontextprotocol.io`.
- Website (`HomeLanding.vue`, 5 locales) — MCP badge updated to surface the registry listing, FAQ answer for MCP install now leads with the `claude mcp add gitwand -- npx -y @gitwand/mcp` one-liner, and the CLI platform card fixes the stale `npm i -g gitwand` (was never a valid package name) to `npm i -g @gitwand/cli`.
- Root README roadmap — the `published to npm + MCP Registry` line is checked off with a ship date.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed

- **CI release — tauri-bundler failing on every platform** — the `parity_probe` test binary was declared as `[[bin]]` with `required-features = ["parity-probe"]`. tauri-bundler auto-discovers **every** `[[bin]]` entry in `Cargo.toml` and tries to embed it as a sidecar in the final bundle, regardless of whether the feature was enabled — so release builds failed with `Failed to copy binary from .../target/release/parity_probe: does not exist`. Fix: move the probe from `[[bin]]` to `[[example]]` (examples are ignored by tauri-bundler and aren't built by default). Source moves from `src-tauri/src/bin/parity_probe.rs` to `src-tauri/examples/parity_probe.rs`; build command becomes `cargo build --example parity-probe`; output path becomes `target/debug/examples/parity-probe`. Parity harness default path updated accordingly.
- **macOS permission dialog prompting 50× on home folder** — opening the home directory triggered a `.join(".git").exists()` probe on every entry, which hit macOS TCC for `Documents`, `Desktop`, `Downloads`, `Pictures`, `Movies`, `Music`, and `Library`. Unsigned/ad-hoc dev builds don't persist TCC decisions, so the dialog reappeared for every child access. Fix: `MACOS_TCC_PROTECTED` guard in both the Rust (`list_dir`) and Node (`dev-server.mjs`) backends skips the `.git` probe for these well-known system folders when listing the home directory — they're never git repos anyway.
- **Unused variable warning** — `shortcut` → `_shortcut` in the global-shortcut closure at `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` (silences the clippy warning in release builds).

### Changed

- `@gitwand/core`, `@gitwand/desktop`, and `gitwand-website` bumped to `1.5.1`.

### Internals

- **i18n sweep — composable errors** — the remaining hardcoded French error strings in the AI-powered composables (`useCommitMessage`, `useBranchName`, `useReleaseNotes`, `useStashMessage`, `usePrDescription`, `useSquashSuggestion`, `usePrHunkCritique`, `useBlameContext`, `useMergeRisk`, `useCommitSearch`, `useHunkExplanation`, `useAIProvider`) now route through the `errors.*` namespace populated in all 5 locales. A standalone `t` helper is exported from `useI18n` so non-component modules can translate without instantiating the composable.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-19

### Security

- **XSS hardening across 10 views** — all `v-html` usage now routes through a shared `useSafeHtml` / `useMarkdown` composable that sanitizes output with DOMPurify (markdown-it for the markdown path). README rendering, PR bodies, commit-message previews, and every other bit of user- or Git-authored markup is filtered through a conservative DOMPurify profile with a URI allow-list, `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"` hardening, and `javascript:` protocol blocking.
- **Dev-server CORS + filesystem path enforcement** — the Node dev-server now refuses requests from unexpected origins and validates every repo/file path against a safe root, preventing path traversal on the desktop app's local HTTP bridge.

### Added

- **English-first UI** (P3.1) — the desktop app now defaults to English, with French as a secondary locale kept in sync. The locale registry's source of truth moves from `fr.ts` to `en.ts`, and the public website landing page mirrors the same default. French is automatically picked up when the browser / OS prefers it, and the Settings panel still lets users force either language.
- **`.gitwandrc` — `generatedFiles` option** (P2.4) — users can now declare extra glob patterns (e.g. `"dist/**"`, `"**/*.generated.ts"`) that GitWand treats as generated when applying the `generated_file` resolver. Patterns are additive on top of the built-in list.
- **Post-merge validation — YAML + TOML** (P2.5) — the `validateMergedContent` contract is extended with format-specific parsers. Invalid YAML / TOML after a merge is surfaced as a `syntaxError` with a `YAML: …` / `TOML: …` prefix, matching the existing JSON behaviour.
- **3 new parity-tested Tauri↔Node commands** (P2.3) — the Rust/Tauri and Node/dev-server backends now share a parity probe harness to catch drift; 3 commands are validated end-to-end on every build.

### Changed

- `@gitwand/core` and `@gitwand/desktop` bumped to `1.5.0`.
- `@gitwand/cli` and `@gitwand/mcp` bumped to `1.3.0` (parallel CLI loop, module split).
- `gitwand-website` bumped to `1.5.0` and aligned with the app release tag.

### Performance

- **LCS memory — O(n·m) → O(min(n, m))** (P2.1) — the diff engine's LCS now runs a hybrid `Int32Array` DP under 4M cells and switches to Hirschberg's divide-and-conquer above. Measured on 3000×3000 inputs: ~36 MB → ~1 MB, a ~35× reduction. Tie-break behaviour is preserved so existing diffs are byte-identical.
- **Parallel conflict loading in the desktop app** (P1.2) — conflicted files are read in parallel instead of one-by-one, with bounded concurrency. Same concurrency model applied to `saveAllFiles`.
- **Parallel CLI file loop** (P1.3) — `gitwand resolve` walks the conflict set concurrently (bounded) rather than serially. Throughput scales with file count on big merges.

### Internals

- **Shared markdown pipeline** (P1.4) — every view that used to call markdown-it / DOMPurify directly now goes through a single `useMarkdown` composable.
- **Resolver refactor** (P1.1) — the monolithic `resolver.ts` was split into 6 focused sub-modules (`validation`, `policy`, `generated-detection`, …), keeping the public API identical.
- **CLI refactor** (P2.2) — `cli/index.ts` split into sub-modules, one per command concern.
- Removed deprecated `@types/dompurify` — DOMPurify 3.x ships its own types.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added

#### AI Everywhere (Phase 1.3.x)

- **AI branch-name suggestion** (1.3.1) — generate `feat/…` / `fix/…` branch names from a description or the staged diff.
- **AI PR title & description** (1.3.1) — `PrCreateView` analyses the `currentBranch..base` diff and produces a structured title + body (summary, test plan, breaking changes).
- **Hunk-level AI critique in PR Review** (1.3.1) — the Intelligence panel now surfaces per-hunk feedback (risks, regressions, concrete suggestions) instead of static heuristics.
- **Natural-language conflict explanation** (1.3.2) — the DecisionTrace is translated into plain English inside the merge editor ("this hunk changes the `login()` signature on both sides — manual resolution required").
- **Pre-merge AI risk summary** (1.3.2) — `MergePreview` complements the `merge-tree` simulation with an AI summary of risk ("3 files touch auth, high regression probability if untested").
- **AI stash message** (1.3.3) — the stash flow (including the switch-branch modal) proposes a message from the unstaged diff.
- **AI semantic squash grouping** (1.3.3) — interactive rebase groups candidate commits by intent and proposes a combined message.
- **AI-ranked Absorb target** (1.3.3) — when lines span multiple commits, the best candidate is picked from a semantic ranking rather than the first `git blame` hit.
- **Natural-language commit search** (1.3.4) — query the log with plain-English questions ("when did we introduce log pagination?").
- **AI blame context** (1.3.4) — "why did this line change?" button on each blame block, with context from neighbouring commits.
- **AI release notes generator** (1.3.4) — structured markdown (Added / Changed / Fixed) from `git log <tag>..<tag>`, ready to paste into a GitHub release.
- **Rotating feature tips on the empty state** (1.3.5) — a pool of ~20 localised tips cycles every 30 s on the dashboard before repo selection.

#### Conflict engine — v1.4

- **Pattern registry** — classification pipeline rewritten around a prioritised pattern registry; each pattern declares its `priority`, `requires` (`diff3` / `diff2` / `both`), `detect`, `confidence`, and `explanation`.
- **New resolver: `reorder_only`** — detects pure permutations (same lines on both sides, different order). Auto-resolved.
- **New resolver: `insertion_at_boundary`** — detects pure insertions on both sides with an intact base. Auto-resolved.
- **Refined confidence scoring** — boosters, penalties, and dimensions tuned for the two new patterns and for stricter guarding on `complex`.

#### Desktop

- **Auto-update check** — background check against the GitHub Releases feed on app launch, with a toast + changelog link when a new version is available.
- **App version display** — current version now visible in the footer / About section.

#### Branding

- Shared hex-cube favicon across desktop app and website.

### Changed

- `@gitwand/core`, `@gitwand/cli`, `@gitwand/mcp`, `gitwand-vscode`, `gitwand-website`, `@gitwand/desktop` versions aligned to `1.4.0`.
- `ConflictType` union extended with `reorder_only` and `insertion_at_boundary`.
- Replaced hardcoded CSS values with design tokens across desktop views.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- **Interactive rebase** (Phase 1.2.1) — drag-and-drop reorder in the log, per-commit actions (squash, edit message, drop, fixup), multi-select squash with combined message, rebase onto branch from the UI, in-flight conflict handling (continue/abort/skip).
- **Absorb** (Phase 1.2.2, inspired by GitButler) — right-click a modified file to absorb it into an existing commit, automatic candidate detection via `git blame`, partial absorb through hunk selection (`useAbsorb.ts`).
- **AI commit messages** (Phase 1.2.3) — dropdown in the commit area analyses the staged diff and produces summary + description. Provider-agnostic: Claude Code CLI, Claude API, OpenAI-compatible, Ollama. Regenerate, shorten, expand, switch language.
- **Universal Undo** (Phase 1.2.4) — operation stack covering commit, merge, rebase, cherry-pick, stash, discard. One-click undo via `git reset` / `git reflog`. History panel lets you jump back to any prior state.
- `gh-merge-pr` endpoint in the desktop dev-server plus a TypeScript wrapper.
- Website homepage: new LLM/MCP section and FAQ.

### Changed

- `@gitwand/core`, `@gitwand/cli`, `@gitwand/mcp`, `gitwand-vscode`, `gitwand-website` versions aligned to `1.2.0`.
- Desktop app (`@gitwand/desktop`) and Tauri bundle bumped to `1.2.0`.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04

### Added

- **MCP server** (`@gitwand/mcp`) — 5 tools (`gitwand_status`, `gitwand_resolve_conflicts`, `gitwand_preview_merge`, `gitwand_explain_hunk`, `gitwand_apply_resolution`) and 3 resources, stdio transport, compatible with Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf.
- **Claude Code slash commands** — `/resolve` and `/preview` workflows.
- **Enriched CLI JSON output** — confidence scores, decision traces, `pendingHunks` with ours/theirs/base, post-merge validation.
- **Partial resolution** in the desktop app — apply resolvable hunks even when others remain manual.
- **Merge success modal** with Close and Push actions, light/dark themed via design tokens.
- **Dashboard README improvements** — GitHub-style header parsing, GFM tables, checkboxes, anchor navigation, relative image handling.
- **Website MCP Server page** and FR/EN homepage toggle.
- **New 3D hexagonal cube logo**; Tauri app icons regenerated (ico, icns, multi-size PNG).

## [1.0.0] - 2026

### Added

- Core conflict resolution engine: 8 patterns (same_change, one_side_change, delete_no_change, whitespace_only, non_overlapping, value_only_change, generated_file, complex), LCS 3-way, diff2 + diff3.
- Composite confidence scoring (`ConfidenceScore` 0–100), configurable merge policies via `.gitwandrc`, decision trace, explain-only mode.
- Format-aware resolvers: JSON/JSONC, Markdown, YAML, Vue SFC, CSS/SCSS, TS/JS imports, npm/yarn/pnpm lockfiles.
- CLI (`gitwand resolve`, `gitwand status`) with `--ci` / `--json` structured output.
- VS Code extension: diagnostics, CodeLens, status bar, `resolveFile` / `resolveAll` commands.

- 332 tests, 20 fixtures corpus, benchmarks (249k ops/s on single conflict).
- CI/CD multi-OS (macOS universal, Linux, Windows), Tauri updater, VitePress documentation site.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-04-03

### Added

- **Core engine** (`@gitwand/core`) with 5 automatic conflict resolution patterns:
  - `same_change` — both branches made the exact same edit (certain)
  - `one_side_change` — only one branch modified a block (certain)
  - `delete_no_change` — one branch deleted, the other didn't touch (certain)
  - `whitespace_only` — same code, different formatting (high)
  - `non_overlapping` — additions at different locations, LCS-based 3-way diff (high)
- **CLI** (`@gitwand/cli`) with commands:
  - `gitwand resolve` — auto-resolve trivial conflicts
  - `gitwand status` — show conflict status
  - `--ci` / `--json` mode with structured JSON output and exit codes
  - `--dry-run`, `--verbose`, `--no-whitespace` options
- **VS Code extension** (`gitwand-vscode`) with:
  - DiagnosticsProvider — inline warnings on each conflict
  - CodeLensProvider — clickable annotations above each conflict marker

  - Commands: `resolveFile`, `resolveAll`
- **Desktop app placeholder** (Tauri + Vue 3, Phase 4)
- CI pipeline via GitHub Actions (Node 18, 20, 22)
- 28 tests covering all patterns + real-world scenarios (package.json, Laravel routes, Vue SFC, CSS, .env files)
