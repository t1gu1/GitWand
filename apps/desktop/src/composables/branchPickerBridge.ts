/**
 * Counter-bump bridges between the native macOS menu (or any other
 * external trigger) and the components that own a popover / focus state.
 *
 * Pattern: the producer (App.vue) `provide()`s a `Ref<number>`. Each
 * caller does `ref.value++`. The consumer `inject()`s and `watch()`es —
 * any change reopens the target. Counter (not boolean) so repeated taps
 * still fire even when the popover was already open.
 *
 * Adding a new bridge: declare a new symbol here, provide it once in
 * App.vue, watch it once in the owning component. Don't reuse a key
 * across consumers — each popover gets its own counter.
