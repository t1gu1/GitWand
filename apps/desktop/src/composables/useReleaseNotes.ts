This project has never been released before, so there is NO previous
version to compare against. Do NOT frame anything as changes, updates,
fixes, or breaking changes — nothing is "new since last time" because
there was no last time. This is the debut.

Tone: warm, welcoming, a little proud. "Here is this project and
everything it offers." Present the features that exist today, not a
history of how they were built.

Rules:
- Output strict Markdown, ready to paste into a GitHub release. No code
  fences around the whole thing, no preamble outside the document itself.
- Start with a single H2 heading announcing the release, including the
  target ref shown below (never higher than H2), followed by ONE or two
  sentences introducing what the project is and who it's for.
- Then list what the project offers under these sections, ONLY if
  non-empty:
    ## Highlights — the headline capabilities, the reasons to care
    ## Features   — the full set of user-facing features it ships with
- Each bullet is ONE line, user-centric, written in the PRESENT tense as
  a capability the project HAS ("Resolves merge conflicts automatically",
  not "Added automatic conflict resolution"). No commit hashes, no author
  names, no trailers.
- Collapse build/CI/refactor/chore/"wip"/"fix typo" commits away
  entirely — an inaugural announcement never mentions internal plumbing.
- Do NOT include Changed, Fixed, Security, Breaking changes, or Internal
  sections. There are no deltas to report.
- Synthesize the commit list into the product's capabilities; do not
  enumerate commits. Do not invent features that aren't supported by the
  commit list.
- Write every heading and bullet in ${lang}.
- Keep the whole output under 3000 characters.`;

commits.

Rules:
- Output strict Markdown, ready to paste into a GitHub release or a
  CHANGELOG.md. No code fences around the whole thing, no preamble
  outside the document itself.
- Structure the notes with the following sections, ONLY if non-empty:
    ## Added     — new user-facing features
    ## Changed   — improvements, renames, perf
    ## Fixed     — bug fixes
    ## Security  — CVE / auth / trust fixes
    ## Breaking changes — API / behaviour breaks (top priority)
    ## Internal  — tooling / CI / refactor with no user impact
- Each bullet is ONE line, user-centric, imperative. No commit hashes,
  no author names, no trailers.
- Merge commits, release bumps ("chore: 1.2.3"), and pure-noise
  commits ("wip", "fix typo") should be collapsed into a single
  bullet in the matching section, or dropped entirely.
- Write every heading and bullet in ${lang}. Keep the headings in
  ${lang} (Ajouté / Modifié / Corrigé / Sécurité / Changements bloquants
  / Interne in French; Added / Changed / Fixed / Security / Breaking
  changes / Internal in English).
- Start the output with a single H2 heading that includes the target
  ref (e.g. "## Release v1.3.0") — never higher than H2.
- Keep the whole output under 3000 characters.
- Do not invent features that aren't in the commit list.`;
