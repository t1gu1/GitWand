GitWand is a lightweight, native Git client built with Tauri 2 and Vue 3. It covers the full daily workflow — changes, history, branches, push/pull — and goes further with **automatic resolution of trivial merge conflicts**, **integrated PR code review** with inline comments, and a **Git Tree** as the primary history view. Since v1.3, AI assists every step of the workflow — branch naming, PR writing, hunk-level review, semantic squash, and natural-language commit search. v2.7+ adds multi-repo Workspaces and Worktrees; v2.8 adds Agent Sessions (MCP); v2.9 adds a cross-repo Launchpad.

## Desktop app

### Git Tree

The **Git Tree** is the primary history view — a full-resolution DAG that renders the branch topology as an SVG with trunk-pinning, lane cooldowns, WIP node, and ref badges. Click any commit to see its diff; right-click to checkout, reset, branch, tag, or cherry-pick. Branches, stashes, and tags are all managed from here without a separate panel.

### Repository view

Staged, unstaged, untracked, and conflicted files in a sidebar with inline diffs in the main area. Stage, unstage, discard, and commit without leaving the interface. Partial staging at the line or hunk level.

### Commit workflow

Summary + description fields, optional commit signature, Ctrl+Enter shortcut. **Unpushed commits can be amended** directly from the Git Tree — a pencil icon appears on hover, opening an overlay pre-filled with the existing message.

### Branches

Click the branch name in the header to search, switch, create, or delete branches. Merge any branch from the dedicated merge button. Each non-current branch shows a **merge preview button** that simulates the merge result before committing.

### Merge preview

Before merging a branch, GitWand predicts the outcome without touching the working tree — using `git merge-base`, `git show`, and `git merge-file -p --diff3`. The result shows a per-file breakdown:

- **Auto-resolvable** — GitWand can handle it automatically
- **Partial** — some hunks need manual resolution
- **Manual** — complex conflicts requiring human judgment
- **Add/delete** — file added on one side, deleted on the other

A badge summarises the overall result: `Clean merge`, `100% auto-resolvable`, or `N conflicts to review`.

### Push & Pull

One-click push and pull with badge counters showing ahead/behind commits. Auto-fetch runs in the background every 30 seconds.

### Diff viewer

Side-by-side or inline toggle, persisted across sessions. Syntax highlighting for 30+ languages, word-level diff using LCS, collapsible unchanged regions, canvas minimap, hunk navigation (prev/next), double-column line numbers.

### File history & blame

Full file history with `git log --follow`, blame view grouped by commit, time-travel diff between any two versions of a file.

### Repo switcher & Workspaces

The current repo name in the header opens a dropdown showing recently opened repositories. Pin favourites, switch instantly — no file picker needed. **Workspaces** (v2.7) group multiple repos into a single dashboard with cross-repo status, coordinated push/pull, and quick-create worktrees (`⌘⇧N`).

### Launchpad

**Launchpad** (`⌘L`, v2.9) is a cross-repo dashboard with four tabs — WIP, PRs, Issues, Team — for a bird's-eye view of everything in flight. Pin or snooze any item; the Team tab loads lazily for performance on large workspaces.

### Pull Requests & Code Review

Browse, create, checkout, and merge GitHub PRs without leaving the app. The PR list sits in the sidebar and the full detail — diff, CI checks, comments, inline review — fills the main area.

- **Inline comments** — read and write review comments anchored to diff lines, with full threading and code suggestions (` ```suggestion ``` ` blocks applicable in one click)
- **Review submission** — Approve / Request changes / Comment, with a draft queue to accumulate comments before sending
- **🧠 Intelligence panel** — conflict prediction (`git merge-tree` before merging), hotspot analysis, review scope, static AI suggestions, file review history

### Agent Sessions

The **Agents panel** (v2.8) shows active MCP sessions and lets you launch Claude Code directly from GitWand — the agent's changes appear live in the diff viewer. The MCP catalog (`Settings > MCP`) lets you install any MCP server in one click.

### Settings

Language (FR/EN, OS auto-detected), theme (dark/light/system), commit signature, diff mode, AI provider (Claude / OpenAI-compatible / Ollama), external editor, Git binary path, switch behavior (stash/ask/refuse). All persisted in app settings.

### Installing

Download the latest build for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/devlint/GitWand/releases):

- **macOS** — `.dmg` (Universal: Apple Silicon + Intel, Developer ID signed + Apple-notarized)
- **Linux** — `.AppImage` or `.deb`
- **Windows** — `.msi` or `.exe`

### Running from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devlint/GitWand.git
cd GitWand
pnpm install

# Browser dev mode — no Rust needed
cd apps/desktop && pnpm dev:web

# Tauri desktop mode — requires Rust toolchain

## Conflict resolution engine

GitWand's core engine (`@gitwand/core`) automatically resolves trivial Git merge conflicts. It never touches complex or ambiguous hunks.

### Resolution patterns

GitWand uses a **pattern registry** — the classifier evaluates patterns in priority order, each declaring whether it requires diff3 (base available), diff2, or works on both.

| Pattern | Description | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| **same_change** | Both branches made the exact same edit | Certain |
| **one_side_change** | Only one branch modified the block | Certain |
| **delete_no_change** | One branch deleted, the other didn't touch it | Certain |
| **non_overlapping** | Additions at different locations in the block | High |
| **whitespace_only** | Same logic, different indentation/spacing | High |
| **reorder_only** | Same lines, different order — pure permutation | High |
| **insertion_at_boundary** | Pure insertions on both sides, base intact | High |
| **value_only_change** | Scalar value update (version number, constant) | Medium |
| **generated_file** | File matches a known generated-file path pattern | High |
| **complex** | Overlapping edits — never auto-resolved | — |

### Composite confidence score

Every resolution carries a `ConfidenceScore` object rather than a simple label:

```ts
{
  score: 84,           // 0–100 composite score
  label: "high",       // "certain" | "high" | "medium" | "low"
  dimensions: {
    typeClassification: 90,  // certainty of the detected pattern
    dataRisk: 20,            // risk of data loss if auto-resolved
    scopeImpact: 10,         // impact of change size
  },
  boosters: ["Path matches generated-file pattern: lockfile"],
  penalties: ["Content will be regenerated — theirs assumed more recent"],
}
```

Score formula: `score = typeClassification − dataRisk×0.4 − scopeImpact×0.15`

### Format-aware resolvers

For structured files, GitWand uses semantic resolvers before falling back to text matching:

- **JSON / JSONC** — recursive key-by-key merge using `JSON.parse`/`JSON.stringify`. Handles nested objects, detects unresolvable scalar conflicts, strips comments in `.jsonc`.
- **Markdown** — section-aware merge by ATX heading (H1–H6). Merges independent sections, falls back to text if the same section is modified on both sides.

### Configurable merge policies

Create a `.gitwandrc` file at the project root to define resolution strategies:

```json
{
  "policy": "prefer-merge",
  "patternOverrides": {
    "*.lock": "prefer-theirs",
    "src/generated/**": "prefer-theirs",
    "CHANGELOG.md": "prefer-ours"
  }
}
```

Available policies: `prefer-ours`, `prefer-theirs`, `prefer-safety`, `prefer-merge`, `strict`.

### Decision trace

Every classification step is logged in a `DecisionTrace` for auditing and debugging:

```
✓ src/config.ts — 3/3 resolved
  L12 [one_side_change] certain — Only the incoming branch modified this block.
  L25 [same_change] certain — Both branches made the exact same edit.
  L41 [value_only_change:json] high — Scalar value updated on one side (version field).
```

## CLI

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@gitwand/cli?color=22c55e&label=%40gitwand%2Fcli)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gitwand/cli)

```bash
# Use directly with npx
npx @gitwand/cli resolve

# Or install globally
npm install -g @gitwand/cli
```

```bash
gitwand resolve              # Resolve all conflicted files in the repo
gitwand resolve --dry-run    # Preview without writing
gitwand resolve --verbose    # Detailed decision trace
gitwand status               # Show conflict status per file
gitwand resolve --ci         # CI mode: JSON output + semantic exit codes
```

### Enriched JSON output

The `--ci` / `--json` flag returns a full structured report with composite confidence scores, decision traces, and pending hunks for LLM-assisted resolution:

```json
{
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "timestamp": "2026-04-14T12:00:00.000Z",
  "summary": {
    "files": 2,
    "totalConflicts": 5,
    "autoResolved": 4,
    "remaining": 1,
    "allResolved": false
  },
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "src/config.ts",
      "totalConflicts": 3,
      "autoResolved": 3,
      "remaining": 0,
      "validation": {
        "isValid": true,
        "hasResidualMarkers": false,
        "syntaxError": null
      },
      "resolutions": [
        {
          "line": 15,
          "type": "one_side_change",
          "resolved": true,
          "explanation": "Only one side modified this block",
          "confidence": {
            "score": 95,
            "label": "certain",
            "typeClassification": 100,
            "dataRisk": 5,
            "scopeImpact": 10
          },
          "trace": {
            "selected": "theirs",
            "hasBase": true,
            "summary": "One-side change detected — incoming accepted.",
            "steps": ["..."]
          }
        }
      ],
      "pendingHunks": []
    }
  ]
}
```

The `pendingHunks` array gives AI agents and CI scripts everything they need to handle the conflicts that GitWand can't auto-resolve — the ours/theirs/base content, the classification trace, and the confidence breakdown.

## MCP Server

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@gitwand/mcp?color=22c55e&label=%40gitwand%2Fmcp)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gitwand/mcp)
[![MCP Registry](https://img.shields.io/badge/MCP%20Registry-listed-22c55e)](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/?search=gitwand)

GitWand ships an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes its conflict resolution engine to AI agents — Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, and any MCP-compatible client.

### Setup

Add this to your MCP client configuration (e.g. `claude_desktop_config.json` or `.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gitwand": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@gitwand/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

The server defaults to the working directory of the client. To pin it to a specific repo, add `"--cwd", "/absolute/path/to/repo"` to the `args` array. With Claude Code, install in one line:

```bash
claude mcp add gitwand -- npx -y @gitwand/mcp
```

### Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `gitwand_status` | List conflicted files with their complexity and auto-resolvability |
| `gitwand_resolve_conflicts` | Auto-resolve trivial conflicts, return DecisionTrace + pendingHunks |
| `gitwand_preview_merge` | Dry-run resolution — stats and risk assessment without writing files |
| `gitwand_explain_hunk` | Explain why a specific hunk was classified its type (full trace + context) |
| `gitwand_apply_resolution` | Apply a custom (LLM-provided) resolution to a specific complex hunk |

### Resources

| URI | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `gitwand://repo/conflicts` | Current conflict state — files, counts, types |
| `gitwand://repo/policy` | Active `.gitwandrc` configuration |
| `gitwand://hunk/{file}/{line}` | Raw hunk content for a specific conflict |

### The human ↔ LLM collaboration loop

The MCP server enables a powerful workflow where GitWand handles the trivial conflicts automatically and the LLM tackles the complex ones:

1. **LLM calls `gitwand_preview_merge`** — sees how many conflicts exist and how many GitWand can handle
2. **LLM calls `gitwand_resolve_conflicts`** — GitWand auto-resolves the easy ones, returns `pendingHunks` for the rest
3. **LLM reads the `pendingHunks`** — each one contains ours/theirs/base content and a full decision trace
4. **LLM calls `gitwand_apply_resolution`** for each pending hunk — writes its resolution directly

### Claude Code slash commands

GitWand also ships `.claude/commands/` for Claude Code:

```bash
/resolve   # Full conflict resolution workflow
/preview   # Merge preview and risk assessment
```

```

The core engine is framework-agnostic and usable as a library:

```ts
import { resolve } from "@gitwand/core";

const result = resolve(conflictedContent, "src/app.ts");
console.log(`${result.stats.autoResolved}/${result.stats.totalConflicts} resolved`);

// With options
const result = resolve(content, "package.json", {
  policy: "prefer-merge",
  minConfidence: "medium",
  patternOverrides: { "*.lock": "prefer-theirs" },
});
```

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devlint/GitWand.git
cd GitWand
pnpm install
pnpm build          # Build all packages
pnpm test           # Tests across all workspaces
```

### Running benchmarks

```bash
cd packages/core
pnpm test:bench     # vitest bench — ops/s per fixture size
```

Baseline results on Apple M-series:

| Input | Throughput |
|---|---|
| 1 conflict / ~30 lines | ~249 000 ops/s |
| 5 conflicts / ~140 lines | ~40 000 ops/s |
| 50 conflicts / ~1350 lines | ~4 500 ops/s |
| JSON/Markdown format-aware | ~137 000 ops/s |

### Internationalization

GitWand uses a zero-dependency type-safe i18n system. `fr.ts` is the reference locale defined with `as const`. `en.ts` must match the same structure — TypeScript enforces it. The `useI18n()` composable provides `t(key, ...args)` with dotted key resolution and positional interpolation. OS language is auto-detected; users can override in Settings.
